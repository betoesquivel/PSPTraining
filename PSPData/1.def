  <defect num="1" type="Function" inj="Design" rem="Code" ft="15.8" fd="" desc="Forgot to add extra functions of the Parser in the design phase, therefore, I need to design them and declare them now in the coding phase. " count="9" date="@1424469624787" />
  <defect num="2" type="Function" inj="Design" rem="Code" ft="53.6" fd="" desc="Forgot to design the regular expressions for all the things I am looking for: single line comments, multi-line comments, all 5 tags, each tag individually, strings, and single brakets.  " count="10" date="@1424632500066" />
  <defect num="3" type="Function" inj="Design" rem="Code" ft="4.3" fd="" desc="Forgot to create a parser function that breaks a string into parts based on the appearance of part tags." date="@1424657559489" />
  <defect num="4" type="Function" inj="Code" rem="Test" ft="5.1" fd="" desc="The code parts where not being parsed because I forgot to call parseParts on the parseFiles method in FileLineSorter." date="@1424663167117" />
  <defect num="5" type="Function" inj="Design" rem="Test" ft="40.8" fd="" desc="I am counting extra lines in my total because my regular expressions where wrong. &#10;The regexp for single brackets wasn't considering that spaces before and after still count like nothing. &#10;The regexp for multiline comments wasn't matching with multiline comments, because I was missing the Pattern.DOTALL parameter." count="2" date="@1424663481032" />
  <defect num="6" type="Function" inj="Code" rem="Test" ft="2.2" fd="" desc="I was not deleting single comment lines correctly because I didn't check for the case where the comments came alone //. I always expected at least one character in my regexp. " date="@1424666209295" />
  <defect num="7" type="Function" inj="Test" rem="Test" ft="3.2" fd="6" desc="I updated incorrectly the regexp for single line comment and was deleting all tags before I counted them. This ended up in the program not counting any tags. " date="@1424666332552" />
  <defect num="8" type="Function" inj="Code" rem="Test" ft="17.3" fd="" desc="My multiline comment was being greedy and eating up multiple comments at once. This resulted in one less line been counted in the first test case. &#10;The solution was to make the comment regexp more complex. Accepting only characters that where not * or that where * but where not followed by a */ character. This removed the greediness." date="@1424584800000" />
  <defect num="9" type="Documentation" inj="Design" rem="Test" ft="24.6" fd="" desc="Did design the test files, but I did not code the test cases in the design phase. So I am missing the code to test my test cases. " date="@1424668646957" />
  <defect num="10" type="Documentation" inj="Design" rem="Test" ft="4.7" fd="" desc="I counted in a wrong way the lines in my test files. I just checked that. " count="2" date="@1424670662922" />
